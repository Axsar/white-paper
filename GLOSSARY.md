Bitcoin Improvement Proposals

# BIP32

This BIP defines the standard for hierarchical deterministic ("HD") wallets. HD wallets have tree structures where public/private parent keys can create a sequence of child keys, child keys can create a sequence of grandchild keys, and so on with an infinite number of generations and keys. Each parent can generate 2 billion child keys.

# BIP39

This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence -- a group of easy-to-remember words -- for the generation of deterministic wallets.

# BIP43

This BIP introduces a "purpose" field for use in deterministic wallets based on the algorithm described in BIP32.

# BIP44

This BIP defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on the purpose scheme described in BIP43 for creating BIP32 wallets.

# BIP45

This BIP defines a structure for hierarchical deterministic P2SH multi-party multi-signature wallets based on the purpose scheme described in BIP43 for creating BIP32 wallets.

# Bitcoin

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

# Blockchain

The blockchain is a decentralized, immutable, public ledger of all transactions in the bitcoin network.

# DHT

Distributed Hash Table: a decentralized, distributed system for storing key/value pairs where any node in the network can efficiently retrieve a value given a certain key. Ability to map keys to values is distributed among the nodes, such that changes to participating nodes is minimally disruptive.

# HD Wallet

Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet defined in BIP32.

# TOR

The Onion Router: free and open source software for anonymous communication that works by progressively encrypting and decrypting messages, including the destination address, as messages move through network nodes.
