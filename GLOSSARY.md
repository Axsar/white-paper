# BIP32

Bitcoin wallet standard for hierarchical deterministic or "HD wallets". Hierarchical deterministic wallets have tree structures where public/private parent keys can create a sequence of child keys, child keys can create a sequence of grandchild keys, and so on with an infinite number of generations and keys. Each parent can generate 2 billion children keys.

# BIP39

This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence -- a group of easy to
remember words -- for the generation of deterministic wallets.

# BIP43

This BIP introduces a "Purpose Field" for use in deterministic wallets based on
algorithm described in BIP32.

# Bitcoin

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

# Blockchain

The blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions in the Bitcoin network.

# DHT

Distributed Hash tables are a decentralized, distributed system for storing key/value pairs where any node in the network can efficiently retrieve a value given a certain key. Ability to map keys to values is distributed among the nodes, such that changes to participating nodes is minimally disruptive.

# HD Wallet

Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet defined in BIP32.

# TOR

TOR, or, as it was initially called, The Onion Router, is free and open source software for anonymous communication that works by progressively encrypting and decrypting messages, including the destination address, as messages move through network nodes.
