# Conclusion

Using the HD Wallet structure allows for several benefits to be built into the design:

1. Data agnostic. Securely input, access and/share share any kind of file or record quickly, anytime, by providing keys and digital signatures. Using a public-private key hierarchy for data access provides for a universal address to read or write information based on an individualâ€™s HD Wallet.

2. Structured access. A way to organize authorized access to information into a structured hierarchy.

3. Proven identity without storing 3rd party personal info. improved anonymous information sharing that could be used as a public or shared private asset.

4. Blockchain available, but not dependent. Information sharing transactions can be tied directly to a universal ledger as a public proof and/or as a financial transaction, but are not required to be. Wallets can be used solely as structured access to a data store, even though wallets are valid bitcoin addresses.

5. Data transactions tied to financial transactions. The same methods for managing keys used in bitcoin can be used for this universal data store.

6. Encapsulation. Because each data element has a unique address, any one breach is insulated from an attack on another

7. Anonymity. Without a high-level key, no one element of data can be tied to any other. With this level of data anonymity, more data can be donated by users for use in various forms of data commons.

8. A Universal set of Addresses. Anyone can send you information securely. Physician's office can send anyone who has granted them acces the information they are required to send to fulfill Meaningful Use requirements, for example.

9. Private longitudinal tracking of everything. All transactions are timestamped, so all records can become a longitudinal record.

10. Security. By default encryption is built in. Share what you want, protect what you want.

11. Personal data as a service. Have an API to share what you want with who you want.
