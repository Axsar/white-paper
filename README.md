# YouBase (Draft 1)

By *Josh Robinson* & *Leonard Kish*

#### Abstract

  > Security, privacy, identity authentication, and accessibility have historically been difficult to balance. Using personal information as part of identity and authentication for secure access creates difficulties keeping this information private. These misalignments have led to enormous cost and risk associated with managing and securing personal records by third parties. YouBase provides a solution to these challenges by using BIP32 public-private key pair trees to build and manage a secure personal data store on a distributed public network.

YouBase provides an individual-centric security structure that separates personal data from identity while allowing for secure and structured read and/or write access to trusted parties on a peer-to-peer data store. This structure provides several benefits, including:

1. a way to securely input, access and share any kind of file or record
2. a way to organize authorized access to information into a structured hierarchy
3. improved anonymous information sharing that could be used as a public or shared private asset
4. information sharing transactions can be to be tied to financial transactions

Cryptography combined with distributed applications and databases in peer-to-peer networks provide the fundamental building blocks required for securing stores of individual-centered digital property in an open standards-based manner. By using encryption, digital signatures, digital wallets, and distributed data, ownership of digital information can be managed in a decentralized store. Such a store will be simultaneously secure and private, with strong identity services, while also available anywhere.

Information and rights to that information will ideally follow an individual as she moves through various contexts in her daily life, allowing the ability to authorize trusted, verified identities with read and write access to this information within those contexts. A longitudinal record could be created, including consumer-generated application data, with the individual as the primary controller of access - all independent of a third party.
