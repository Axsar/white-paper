# Introduction

Security, privacy, identity and accessibility have historically been difficult to balance. Using personal information as part of identity for secure access creates difficulties keeping this information private. These misalignements have led to enormous cost and risk associate with managing and securing personal records by third parties. 

Breaches have become all-too-common because of the high value to identity thieves. A premium is paid on the black market for such records, estimated at $50 per record for medical records. In Q1 2015 alone, nearly 100 million medical record have been compromised, including identity, clinical and financial information. At the same time, a person's ability to access and manage personal information that rests with third parties is difficult.

YouBase provides an individual-centric security structure that separates personal data from identity while allowing for secure and structured read and/or write access to trusted parties. This structure provides for several benefits, including: 1) a way to securely input, access and share any kind of file or record 2) a way to organize authorized access to information into a structured hierarchy 3) improved anonymous information sharing that could be used as a public or shared private asset 4) information sharing transactions can be to be tied directly to a financial transaction.

Cryptography combined with distributed applications and databases in peer-to-peer networks provide the fundamental building blocks required for securing stores of individual-centered digital property and assets in an open standards-based manner. By using encryption, digital signatures, digital wallets and distributed data, ownership of digital information can be managed in a decentralized store. Such a store will be simultaneously secure and private, with strong identity services, yet available anywhere. 

This is a radical shift. In creating such systems, the opportunity exists to solve fundamental issues across B2B, B2C and C2C domains. These problems include 1) managing multiple accounts, identities and preferences, 2) creating trusted, verified identities, 3) linking these identities to a wide variety of attributes and data, such as medical records, social content, confidential documents, as well as authorizations and access to a variety benefits and shared resources. 

Information and rights to that information will ideally follow an individual as she moves through various contexts in her daily life, allowing the ability to authorize read and write access to this information to trusted, verified entities within those contexts. A longitudinal record could be created, including consumer-generated application data, with the individual as the primary controller of access -- all independent of a third party.

As a solution to these challenges, YouBase is an individual-centric, encrypted, decentralized and distributed data store which uses a BIP-32 public-private key pair tree to manage identity and read-write authorizations.
