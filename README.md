# Introduction

Value is lost when we rely on third parties to access and manage our personal information. Relying on third parties inevitably leads to conflicts in data use because third parties are not likely to be completely economically and otherwise aligned with the interests of the individual. For example, these parties may consider an individual's access and ability to share information as a potential cost with little potential upside. The security of individualâ€™s confidential information may be seen as third party's corporate asset, but with relatively low perceived risk to the organization for a data breach. 

Individuals, on the other hand, might have a high perceived risk of a breach of this information, but little control in preventing such a breach. Additionally, individuals will often find ways to reuse and repurpose personal information and could decide to share anonymized information for research or charity. Third parties find great risk and little benefit in doing so.

Cryptographic, distributed and peer-to-peer networks are bringing together the fundamental technologies required for securing stores of individual-centered digital assets independent of any third party. By using digital signatures, bitcoin wallets, and encrypted and distributed data structures, ownership of digital information can be managed in decentralized fashion, available anywhere, yet, beyond control any one organization. 

This is a radical shift. In creating such systems, the opportunity exists to solve fundamental issues across B2B, B2C and C2C domains, including: managing multiple accounts and identities, creating trusted, verified identities, linking these identities to a wide variety of attributes and data. Medical records, social content, confidential documents, as well as authorizations and access to a variety benefits and shared resources are just a few examples . Information and rights to that information would ideally follow an individual as they move through various contexts in their daily life, allowing the ability to authorize read and write access to this information to trusted, verified entities within those contexts. A longitudinal record could be created, including consumer-generated application data, with the individual as the primary controller of access -- all independent of a third party.

The implementation of such a system will create incentives for institutions to build trusted relationships with individuals in order that they could access this information, with the opportunity to provide specific benefits to the individuals for doing so. An individual-centered data store could also open the door to a massive release of individual data for population research, with specific applications in population health, as an example, and not owned by any one organization.

As a solution to these challenges, we propose an individual-centric data store using a BIP-32 based wallet architecture to manage identity and read-write authorizations to an individual-centric, distributed data store.
