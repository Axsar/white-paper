# BIP32

BIP0032, or "bip32", is a bitcoin wallet standard for hierarchical deterministic or "HD wallets". Hierarchical deterministic wallets have tree structures where public/private parent keys can create a sequence of child keys, child keys can create grandchild keys, and so on with an infinite number of generations and keys. 

Providing public/private key pairings in such a structure offer a number of beneifts. First, information secured in wallets with the keys can follow a structure where different kinds of information are stored in different branches of the tree.
