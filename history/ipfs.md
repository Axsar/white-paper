# IPFS

IPFS, or Interplanetary Proprietary File System, is completely peer to peer file system with files encrypted and versioned. File-sharing network nodes are rewarded with fliecoin for their work in storing and serving. Due to P2P nature, IPFS is unified and permanently accessible file system that is independent of any single entity or central repository.
