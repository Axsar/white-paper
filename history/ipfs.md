# IPFS

IPFS stands for Interplanetary Proprietary File System and refers to a unified and permanently accessible file system that exists beyond any one entity or central repository. It's a versioned file system that exists completely peer to peer, with files encrypted, and file-sharing network nodes rewarded with fliecoin for their work in storing and serving.
