# Bitcoin
Bitcoin started in early 2009 with a white paper and reference implentation by an unknown entity calling itelf Satoshi Nakamoto. Records of payments using the virtual currency are stored in a public leger that is agreed upon and stored on bitcoin users' computers. The ledger, known as the blockchain, in combination with the bitcoin protocol, solve what's known as the "double spending" problem by achieving consensus throughout the network on what coins have been spent where. This is the key breakthrough that has allowed bitcoin to rapidly become widely adopted, with approximately $10 billion in circulation, with no central authority.

Bitcoin and the blockchain can also be seen as a generalized accounting system that can be used for tracking many types of transactions beyond just cryptocurrency. Transactions could include voting, notarization and identity, lotteries, asset registries, and tangible and intangible (e.g. data) exchange transactions. Public-private cryptographic keying and digital signatures could be used to manage read and write access to a wide variety of data stores, for example.
